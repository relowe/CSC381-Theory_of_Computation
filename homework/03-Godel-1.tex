\begin{document}
\maketitle

Answer each of the following problems.  As always, you must attempt
all of them.  This time, you must complete all of the easy problems,
and one of the hard problems.  You need only typeset your complete
problems.  Good attempts can be submitted in handwritten form, bad
attempts must be delivered in the form of interpretive dance.

\section{Quiet Desperation (Easier Problems)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Rigorously prove propositions I, II, and III in section 2.
    \item Establish, and prove, a bijection between all finite but 
        unbounded
        sequences  $\langle x_1, x_2, \ldots x_n \rangle$ where $x_i
        \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N}$.
    \item Using \textbf{P}, construct a proof that $\sim a \vee a$ is
        a tautology.
\end{enumerate}

\section{What did we ever do to you? (Harder Problems)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Rigorously prove that \textbf{P} is equivalent to
        \textbf{PM}.
    \item Fully expand all of the abbreviations used in the axioms 
       into the language of \textbf{P}.  Use your expansions to find
       the G\"odel number of the 3 axioms in section I of the axioms.
\end{enumerate}
