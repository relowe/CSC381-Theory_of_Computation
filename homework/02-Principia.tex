\title{Principia Problem Set}
\date{Due: January 29, 2020}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

For each problem, construct a proof which either proves or disproves
the proposition.  The difficulty here is that your proof must be
a Principia Mathematica proof. Your answers must be typeset in latex,
and if you use outside sources, you must cite your work (use Principia
style references to refer to existing Principia theorems.)  For full
credit, you must attempt all of these problems.  In addition to
attempting all problems, you will be graded on your best 2 easier
problems and your best 1 harder problems.  


\section{Easier (but still difficult) Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $a=b+1 \rightarrow b = a-1$
    \item $a=0$ and $b=a+1$ implies that $b=0$
    \item if $a+b = b+c$ then $a=c$
    \item if $a+b = b+c$ then $a=b$
\end{enumerate}

\section{Impressively Difficult Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The set of real numbers is uncountably infinite.
    \item Multiplication is both commutative and distributive.
    \item All positive integers greater than 1 are either prime or
        the product of primes, and the prime factorization of any
        composite number is unique. (This is the fundamental theorem of
        arithmetic.)
\end{enumerate}
